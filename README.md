# K-Pop for a Global Audience: 

Analyzed how songs surfaced through user-curated playlists on Spotify differ in engagement and content characteristics. Using Spotify API data for 27 K-pop groups, I engineered artist- and track-level features including popularity, label affiliation, group composition, and audio attributes.
I first conducted descriptive analyses to understand representation and engagement patterns among playlist-exposed tracks. 

I then modeled selection into playlist exposure using logistic regression and compared engagement metrics across exposure groups while adjusting for confounding characteristics. 

The analysis highlights structural patterns in music discovery, including the role of label affiliation and audio features in playlist visibility and how exposure correlates with engagement signals.
